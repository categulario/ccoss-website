I write software to support data analysis. I try to speak regularly at local and national conferences, and do some technical writing at least once a year. I was a collaborator on the Large Hadron Collider during graduate school and my name is on the Higgs boson discovery paper.

I sometimes get the opportunity to contribute directly to some of the open source projects I use. Among the projects where I have contributed are Apache Kafka, Apache Beam, PostreSQL, matplotlib and sphinx.
