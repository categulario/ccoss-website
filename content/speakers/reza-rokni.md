In his 7 years @Google, Reza has been lucky enough to work with developers from many industries from Gaming to Banking, applying Google's Data Analytics technologies to new domains. Currently as developer advocate for Google Cloud Dataflow and Apache Beam, he gets to have fun talking about stream processing all day long, or should that be stream processing unbounded... :-)
